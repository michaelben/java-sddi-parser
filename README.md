# java-sddl-parser
A well-formed Java Windows SDDL string parser

Microsoft uses SDDL (Security Descriptor Definition Language) strings to describe ACLs on various objects. The project attempts to make it easy to programmatically extract information from SDDL strings for program use and/or format the output into a human-readable format.

More information about SDDL can be found here: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa379567(VS.85).aspx
